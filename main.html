	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity describes how the execution time of an algorithm grows as the size of its input increases. It's a measure of how efficient an algorithm is, focusing on how its runtime changes with larger datasets. Instead of measuring the exact execution time, time complexity analyzes the number of operations or steps an algorithm performs relative to the input size. </p>
	<p>The <b>Space Complexity</b> of an algorithm is the total space taken by the algorithm with respect to the input size. It is a parallel concept to time complexity. If you need to create an array of size n, this will take O(n) space. If you build a two-dimensional array of size n*n, this will need O(n2) space.</p>
